If you lose your car keys, you're in massive trouble!
So keep your car key in safe place or just remember where it is.
Your key is very important if you want to use your car.
That's just the way it is... Can't stop life...
And don't stop programming 'cause that is
the key to your car. Think abstract, not literally.
