1. Engineers in the UK have found that limpets' teeth 
2. consist of the strongest biological material ever tested.
3. Limpets use a tongue bristling with tiny teeth to scrape food 
4. from rocks and also to carve out scars, which they nestle in 
5. when the tide goes out.
6. The teeth are made of a mineral-protein composite, 
7. which the researchers tested in tiny fragments 
8. in the laboratory.
9. They found it was stronger than spider silk, 
10. as well as all but the very strongest of man-made materials.
11. The findings, published in the Royal Society's journal Interface, 
12. suggest that the secret to the material's strength
13. is the thinness of its tightly-packed mineral fibres - 
14. a discovery that could help improve the man-made composites 
15. used to build aircraft, cars and boats, as well as dental fillings.
