Engineers in the UK have found that limpets' teeth 
consist of the strongest biological material ever tested.
Limpets use a tongue bristling with tiny teeth to scrape food 
from rocks and also to carve out scars, which they nestle in 
when the tide goes out.
The teeth are made of a mineral-protein composite, 
which the researchers tested in tiny fragments 
in the laboratory.
They found it was stronger than spider silk, 
as well as all but the very strongest of man-made materials.
The findings, published in the Royal Society's journal Interface, 
suggest that the secret to the material's strength
is the thinness of its tightly-packed mineral fibres - 
a discovery that could help improve the man-made composites 
used to build aircraft, cars and boats, as well as dental fillings.
